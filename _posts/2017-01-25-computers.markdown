The admins will walk through some frequent pain points in using the Lounge computers. Feel free to email topic suggestions to Council (cvcouncil@utdallas.edu) or come to the workshop with your questions.

Wednesday, January 25th @ 1PM - CV Library


UPDATE:  The computer workshop was a smashing success solving 100% of all user issues that were raised during the meeting.  We thank all CV students who came to the workshop and appreciate the feedback that was provided.  If you were unable to attend the workshop please feel free to email your questions in writing to cvadmins@utdallas.edu and an admin will strive to answer your questions.
