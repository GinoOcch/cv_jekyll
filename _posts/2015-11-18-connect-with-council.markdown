As the semester comes to an end, the CV Executive Council would like to welcome and congratulate everyone for making it through the fall semester.<!--more-->  Having accepted over 250 students into the honors program this past fall, the CV Honors Program is rapidly expanding and provides special opportunities in both academics and extracurricular activities.  While many of us juggle a full plate of rigorous courses and other activities, it is easy to become burdened by our various commitments.  The Collegium V Honors Lounge offers a respite from the bustle of classes and club meetings, in which students interact with their colleagues from a variety of majors and make new friends over cups of hot cocoa and rounds of chess.

In addition to these amenities, Council also hosts numerous events such as Pancake Nights, birthday cake celebrations, and the successful racing of the LOL-tanic in the Cardboard Boat Regatta and swing dance party on November 13.  This upcoming December, Council will also be hosting Pancake Night on December 4 at 11 PM at the Residence Hall West Kitchen and a holiday party to celebrate the end of the semester with a white elephant gift exchange, holiday music, cookies, and hot cocoa.  Swing by the CV Lounge to hear more about these events and enjoy the end of the semester with your peers.  On behalf of the CV Executive Council, we wish you luck on your finals and enjoy the well-deserved Fall Break!

Farah Wazir on behalf of CV Council
