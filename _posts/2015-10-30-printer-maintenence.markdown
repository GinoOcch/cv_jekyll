Tonight there will be scheduled maintenence of on the printer subsystem.<!--more-->
UPDATE:  All maintenence has concluded and the printers have been returned to service.  The printers now use an automatic load balancer to move jobs from non-working printers to printers that are up and running.  Printing to Carlson will now send documents to the printers on the quiet side.

UPDATE:  In response to concerns with the noise, the quiet side has been equiped with a computer and a set of speakers to create some masking noise.  The default is a rainstorm, but students are free to change this.
