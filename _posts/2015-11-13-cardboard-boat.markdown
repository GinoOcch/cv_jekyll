Join the CV Council today as we partake in the tradition of sinking in the Cardboard Boat Regatta!<!--more-->  The cardboard boat has been an event for several years now and Collegium V has always made it a point to sink spectacularly.  Come and support us with this year's iteration of the LOL-tanic and enjoy the musical stylings of council played on pocket trumpet and melodica.
