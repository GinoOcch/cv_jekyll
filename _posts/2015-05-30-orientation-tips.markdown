Welcome to UTD and Collegium V, as you make your way to orientation, here are some helpful tips for your trip. <!--more-->

These tips have been compiled by the CV council and the admins and contain some of the advice we wish we'd had when coming to UTD as freshmen.  While we would like to think we know what we're doing now, this advice is of course to be used with discretion and you should always carefully evaluate your options before making any decisions.

Without further delay, here is our advice:

  * Dallas is under heavy construction, be aware that Highway 635 is reduced to 1 lane in places.
  * Register as soon as possible, try to make a schedule before your appointment, courses are listed [here](http://coursebook.utdallas.edu).
  * If you're staying off campus, there is food just to the the West of campus at the corner of Coit and Campbell (large selection).
  * If taking a CS course, make sure to take the CS placement test, its very short.

Moving into the year, we provide this general advice:

  * Come to the CV Lounge, cool people hang out and you learn lots of neat stuff just by hanging out.
  * Go to class, it seems simple, but do it.
    * Similarly, go to office hours.  Letting a professor know that you care means that they are often more willing to spend time helping you understand the material.
  * Find a club or group that interests you, be involved.
    * Similarly, try to make sure you have at least one class each semester that you are fully engaged in.
  * Seek out those smarter than you and learn from them, the lounge is a good place to look.
  * Eat healthy
    * Though you have many choices, eating healthy can keep you feeling well and ready to take on the world.
    * A well balanced diet is available at the dining hall, or if you are living off campus, there are many high quality grocers.
  * Get enough rest
    * 6 hours of sleep is pretty much the minimum, years of empirical data in CV has established this.
    * Strive for 8 hours of good sleep each night, and a good breakfast each morning.
  * Explore the campus and resources around you, UTD has lots to offer if you look for it.
    * The math lab provides excellent help, be prepared to spend plenty of time there.
    * Stress and depression are serious business, but you aren't alone.
      * Seek out trusted peers to talk to.
      * Talk to someone at the Counseling Center, they are available at all hours.
  * Textbooks:
    * Don't buy your textbooks until you know you will need them, its generally safe to not have a book on day 1 of class.
    * Ask upperclassmen about textbooks, they are often willing to sell them cheap or give them away.
    * Look at off-site textbook suppliers such as [Big Words](http://bigwords.com) that compare textbook prices against other sources.
  * Has the lounge been mentioned yet?..

Finally, the CV Systems Administrators would like to provide the following:

  * CometNet can be finicky, connection guides are available [here](http://www.utdallas.edu/ir/howto/cometnet/)
  * Bring an Ethernet cable (~10 feet is a good length).
  * The lounge systems run the CV Operating System, you can find out more [here](https://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client_bleeding)
  * Join IRC, cool people talk about cool stuff and occasionally give out leads to internships.
  * The lounge is full of great people (hopefully you're picking up the theme here...).


Hopefully this advice will bring you a smoother transition to life at UTD as well as keep you from making some of the same mistakes that were made by those who came before you.
