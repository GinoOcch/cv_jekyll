Join us to kick off the year with computer games and board games! <!--more--> While gaming is normally prohibited in the Lounge, we periodically hold game nights where people can meet other CV-ers and enjoy a night off from schoolwork.  The start of semester game night is our largest as it is before any homework has been assigned and before even the first day of class!  Come out and meet CV freshmen and enjoy the culture of the Lounge.

The start of year game night will be held Saturday August 20, 2016 starting at 6:30PM and officially conclude at midnight.  Games in progress will play to completion.
