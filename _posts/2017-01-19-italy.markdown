Join us for an information session for the summer study abroad to Italy. Students will have the opportunity to visit Schloss Brunnenburg, a castle in northern Italy that hosts students from all over the world to study the works of Ezra Pound. Dr. Tim Redman, professor of Literary Studies in the School of Arts and Humanities, brings students to the castle for this unique study abroad experience.
