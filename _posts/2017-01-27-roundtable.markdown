Join the Honors College for a faculty roundtable featuring Dr. Nicholas Fey. Dr. Feyâ€™s background is in biomechanical engineering with a focus on neuormechanics of human locomotion and the design and control of lower-limb assistive devices. His research seeks to identify how given task demands and lower-limb assistive devices contribute to human motor control as well as muscle and device function. He looks at how prostheses can enhance the mobility of amputees. See weekly email for registration details.
