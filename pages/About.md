#About Collegium V

The University of Texas at Dallas commitment to excellence in teaching and research extends to every aspect of academic life in the university. The Collegium V Honors College (col·le·gi·um five) provides a four-year honors experience that encourages intellectually creative, inquisitive, and highly motivated students to extend their educational experience beyond the scope of the classroom. Small classes, innovative instruction, world class faculty, and an array of extracurricular events offer Collegium V members unique opportunities not otherwise available.

##Council

The council is elected from denizens of the lounge each year to plan events, handle CV involvement with on campus activities, and to generally assist in the operation of the lounge.  The council may be contacted in person in the lounge, or by email to any of the council members.  The current CV council is listed below:

##Admins

The CV network is unique at UTD in that it is entirely student managed.  The admins are known mostly by logon identities, and so that is how they are listed below.  The admins may be found on IRC, and in the event that IRC is down, they may be found in the lounge fixing IRC.
