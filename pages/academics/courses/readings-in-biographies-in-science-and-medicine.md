#### Readings in Biographies in Science & Medicine

#### Instructor:  Caitlin Braitsch

#### HONS 3199.H16

Textbooks present scientific facts and findings as independent,
stand-alone truth, but the stories behind these discoveries are much
more human.  How was the structure of DNA discovered?  How did cancer
treatment lead to the broad use of a patient's cancer cells in
biomedical research, and what are the ethical implications today?
What does a life dedicated to science and medicine look like?  In this
class, we will discuss groundbreaking scientific discoveries in the
context of historical and contemporary biographies.
