#### Instructor: Not Released

#### HONS 3199.HN12

The class “Criminal Minds and Lethal Crimes” will explore critical issues related to deviance, criminal psychology, legal precedents, the ideals of justice, and serial homicide.  Students will read three texts and discuss the main themes for the assigned reading weekly in an interactive and open classroom setting.  Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit offers insights into serial killers from John Douglas, one of the pioneers of criminal profiling.  Douglas describes his 25-year career with the FBI and gives intimate details from cases he worked including the Green River killer, the Atlanta child murders, the Manson cult, Ted Bundy and many others.  Inside the Criminal Mind is the second required text for the course; this book offers a glimpse into the psychology of violence and the minds of career criminals.  It examines the characteristics and unique qualities of criminally deviant offenders and assesses typologies of serious criminal behavior from murder to stalking to domestic violence and political terrorism.  Lastly, Murder at the Supreme Court: Lethal Crimes and Landmark Cases provides a behind-the-scenes look by two veteran journalists of seminal Supreme Court murder cases and provides fascinating analyses that extend well beyond the legal issues of each case. With eyewitness accounts, newspaper and media reports, personal interviews, and archived records, the authors highlight colorful life histories and factual details that challenge common perceptions regarding justice and jurisprudence.  No prior knowledge of these subject areas or prerequisites are required for enrollment.
