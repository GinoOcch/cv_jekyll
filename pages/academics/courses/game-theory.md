#### Game Theory

#### Instructor:  Todd Sandler

#### ECON 4301.HN1

This class provides a nontechnical introduction to modern game theory.  In the last thirty years, game theory has become an essential tool in economics, political science, international relations, business administration, and other fields.  Strategic behavior, the hallmark of game theory, involves how one agent (person, nation, firm, government, or institution) behaves when its choices depend on those of others.  Interactive choices that cause players’ payoffs to be interdependent are viewed as strategic.  If, however, what I choose to do is not affected by what another does, then my choice is not strategic.  Strategic behavior also involves a recognition of choice interdependence; one player thinks that the opponent(s) will behave in a certain manner and acts on this presumption.  Similarly, the opponent anticipates the other player’s belief-based actions and chooses a strategy based on this belief, and so it goes.  Each player is putting herself in the other’s shoes and basing her own behavior on how her counterpart would act in these circumstances, knowing that each is trying to anticipate the other’s optimizing actions.

We cover simultaneous-move games, sequential-move games, simultaneous-move games with mixed strategies, theory of strategic moves, collective-action games, Prisoners’ Dilemma and other normal-form games, strategy and voting, brinkmanship, and bargaining.

The course is rich in applications to economics and political science.  Students can pursue applications in a different field with their short paper.  Most of the readings come from the two textbooks.  There are many applications:  global warming, environmental treaties, terrorism, conflict, etc.  I assume no pre-knowledge.  Knowledge of microeconomics principles is helpful but not required.  Some elementary calculus is used.
