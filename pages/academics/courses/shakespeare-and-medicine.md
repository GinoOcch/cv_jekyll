#### Shakespear and Medicine

#### Instructor: Dr. Jessica Murphy

Writing in their 1959 Shakespeare and Medicine, R.R. Simpson claims
“there can be little doubt” that Shakespeare “was aware of the current
medical thought” and that we should understand “medical thought and
writing of the period” to get a better sense of Shakespeare’s medical
references.  In this course, we will look at early modern English
medical texts alongside a few of Shakespeare’s plays to do the work
Simpson calls on us to do. We will draw from current scholarship on
Shakespeare and early modern medicine to enhance our discussions.
