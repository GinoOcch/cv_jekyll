#### Themes and Ideas in American History

#### Instructor: Dr. Annelise Heinz

#### HIST2330.HN1

How have immigrants and their descendants defined themselves in American society? What understandings have also been imposed on them? How do social categories like gender and ethnicity interact and shape people’s lives, communities, and identities? In this class we will focus on how women and men including Jewish, Latino, Asian, and Italian Americans have constructed and maintained a sense of group identity, and how the larger society has perceived them from the 1800s through the 20th century. We will explore how ideas of the “domestic” as meaning both home spaces and national boundaries have created gen-dered forms of belonging and exclusion.
