#### Creating Poetry

#### Instructor: Frederick Turner

#### CRWT3351.HN1

This course will connect two aspects of poetry: its formal musical
means, and its free and playful (and often profound) ends and
meanings. The first thread will consist of a primer in meter and
rhyme: a necessary foundation for beginning poets, and a useful review
for old hands at the poetic forms. The second thread will be a rather
unfashionable look at what poetry actually has to say—for saying is
what language does, and poetry is an art of language. Emmanuel Levinas
observes in Time and the Other that “It sometimes seems to me that the
whole of philosophy is only a meditation of Shakespeare.” Philosophers
of no lesser rank than Plato and Nietzsche have recognized poetry as
serious philosophy, whether as dangerous adversary or as true
source. We will use the experience of seeing from the inside how poets
so richly and economically express their ideas for the immediate
practical purpose of making poetry that is both deep in meaning and
luminously intelligible. The course will include an ongoing workshop
in which students will present their own work for discussion.
