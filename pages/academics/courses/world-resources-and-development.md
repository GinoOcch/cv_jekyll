This class is an interdisciplinary overview of the problem of
improving the material standard of living and overall quality of life
of the earth's human population in ways that are ecologically
sustainable and economically viable. Economic, political, cultural,
sociological and psychological dimensions of this problem are
included. Special attention and emphasis is given to improving the
living standards of the vast majority of the world's people --- those
who live in the less economically developed countries.
