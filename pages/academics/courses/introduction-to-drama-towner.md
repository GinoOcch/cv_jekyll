#### Introduction to Drama

#### Instructor: Timothy Redman

#### THEA1310.HN1

A hands-on approach to understanding theater. We will see two
contemporary plays outside class (tickets provided) during the
semester.  We will read and see film versions of important
plays. Students will work in groups with Chekhov's The Sea Gull.  The
guiding philosophy of the course will be Vico's idea that you can only
understand something by doing it. Vico was an Italian philosopher who
opposed Descartes notion that we understand things by taking a
distance on them and approaching them analytically.
