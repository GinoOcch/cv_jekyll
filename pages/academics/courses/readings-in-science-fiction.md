#### Readings in Science Fiction

#### Instructor:  Christina Thompson

#### HONS 3199.H12

Can we really bring extinct animals back to life through genetic
engineering?  Could vampires be an evolutionary branch of the primate
family?  What kind of virus would cause a zombie apocalypse?  How does
the "descent into madness" of horror literature compare to actual
psychosis?  These are the kinds of questions we will explore through
writing and film in both science and science fiction.  We will address
how accurately biology and neuroscience are depicted in science
fiction, as well as how well science fiction in the past has predicted
future technological developments.  Students will gain new
appreciation for science fiction, and literacy in current topics in
science such as genetics, evolution, and mental illness.
