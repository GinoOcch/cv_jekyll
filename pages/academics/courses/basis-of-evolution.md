#### Basis of Evolution

#### Instructor: Homer Montgomery

#### NATS2330.HN1

Description: Basis of Evolution provides wide-ranging investigations
of the unifying theory of the origin and modification of all organisms
through time. Pertinent history, the fossil record, natural and sexual
selection, evolutionary psychology, and philosophy are major
topics. This course is conducted entirely within a Problem Based
Learning format. As such, there are no formal lectures. Group work is
expected.  The production of highly creative projects is
encouraged. One outstanding example was an original rock opera about
Darwinâ€™s scientific accomplishments produced entirely with finger
puppets. Additionally, students will complete in-class, hands-on
investigations such as probing modifications of hominid crania through
time.  All students will become conversant with evolutionary
theory. All will engage in probing discussions and activities. We will
entertain numerous topical and controversial issues.
